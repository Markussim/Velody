> If need help to **install Node.JS on Linux**, you can find a guide [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_collections/how-to-install-node-js).

To confirm your installation of Node.JS run the following in the terminal or CMD:

```bash
node -v
```

### Setup:

```bash
# Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/linusromland/Velody.git

dir Velody/

#Install necessary dependencies:
npm install

#Create .env file
touch .env

Now you need to setup your .env file. To do this you need to create a Discord Bot and invite it to your server.
