## ‚ö°Ô∏è Setup

First of all, [download](https://nodejs.org/en/) and install **Node.JS**. Version `14` or higher is required.

> If need help to **install Node.JS on Linux**, you can find a guide [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_collections/how-to-install-node-js).

To confirm your installation of Node.JS run the following in the terminal or CMD:

```bash
node -v
```

### Setup:

```bash
# Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/linusromland/Velody.git

# Navigate to folder:
cd Velody/velody-bot

#Install necessary dependencies:
npm install

#Create .env file
touch .env

#Create .env file (for Windows):
type nul > .env
```

Now you need to setup your .env file. To do this you need to create a Discord Bot and invite it to your server.

> If need help to **creating a discord bot**, you can find a guide [here](https://dsharpplus.github.io/articles/basics/bot_account.html).

Also enable slash commands for the bot!

Setup your .env as following:

```bash
TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_REQUIRED
PREFIX=YOUR_PREFIX_FOR_COMMANDS_NOTREQUIRED
CHANNEL_ID=CHANNEL_ID_FOR_WELCOME_MESSAGE_REQUIRED
BOT_OWNER=BOT_OWNER_ID_REQUIRED
```

Next, you can start the bot using the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

That's all you need to know to start! üéâ
